pod 'MaterialSideMenu'
```
After that, run the following command:

```
### Manual
Copy ```MaterialSideMenuViewController.swift``` into your project and build

## Usage
### From code
First:
```swift
import MaterialSideMenu
```
Declare the menu and initialize it with a home controller (the bottom view) and the controller to be used as a side menu:
```swift
let sideMenuViewController = MaterialSideMenuViewController(homeViewController: homeViewController, mainMenuViewController: mainMenuController)
```
The menu is a ```UIViewController``` which can be added either as the ```rootViewController``` or pushed. It has its own ```navigationController``` on which it pushes the new controllers.

Push new view controllers on its stack:
```swift 
sideMenuViewController.pushViewController(newController, animated: false)
```
This will dismiss all view controllers alread on the stack, except the ```homeViewController``` and add the new controller on top.

Go home:
```swift
sideMenuViewController.goHome()
```
Dismisses all view controllers and leaves the home view controller on the stack.
